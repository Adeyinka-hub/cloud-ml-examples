    "# Improving model performance with xfeat, RAPIDS and Optuna\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering is the processing of transforming raw data into features that can represent the underlying patterns of the data better. They can help boost accuracy by a great deal and improve the ability of the model to generalise on unseen data. Every data scientist knows the importance of feature engineering. Spending some time thinking about how best to apply and combine the available features can be very meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyper parameter Optimisation is another such process which can help complement a good model by tuning it's hyperparameters, which can have a tremendous impact on the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time and resources required for these processes are generally the reason they're overlooked. With xfeat, RAPIDS and Optuna - we aim to bridge these gaps and elevate the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Optuna?\n",
    "[Optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna) is a lightweight framework for automatic hyperparameter optimization. It provides a define-by-run API, which makes it easy to adapt to any already existing code that we have and enables high modularity and the flexibility to construct hyperparameter spaces dynamically. By simply wrapping the objective function with Optuna can help perform a parallel-distributed HPO search over a search space. As we'll see in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is xfeat?\n",
    "[xfeat](https://github.com/pfnet-research/xfeat) is a feature engineering & exploration library using GPUs and Optuna. It provides a scikit-learn-like API for feature engineering with support for Pandas, cuDF dataframes and cuPy arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MLflow?\n",
    "[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is an open source platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAPIDS?\n",
    "[RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/about.html) framework  provides a library suite that can execute end-to-end data science pipelines entirely on GPUs.  The libraries in the framework include [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) - a GPU Dataframe with pandas-like API, [cuML](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml) - implement machine learning algorithms that provide a scikit-learn-like API and many more. You can learn more [here](https://github.com/rapidsai).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll show how one can use these tools together to develop and improve a machine learning model. We'll use Airlines dataset (20M rows) to predict if a flight will be delayed or not. We'll explore how to use Optuna with RAPIDS and the speedups that we can achieve with the integration of these, and to see the improvements with GPU speedups. There's a CPU version of this notebook available in the repository here - `optuna/notebooks/jupytercon\\ demo/RAPIDS_xfeat_Optuna-CPU.ipynb`.\n",

This helps in selection of a subset of features that are most informative. This helps in simplifying the problem and ensures that we aren't overloading the system with unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optuna provides a way to choose a selector which accepts a Pipeline object from xfeat. You can see in the `feature_selection` function we define a `Pipeline` that takes in an Explorer and a Selection Algorithm (`ChiSquareKBest`). We pass this to an Optuna Study object, along with an Objective function. \n",

    "\n",
    "The objective function does not need to be changed for different samplers. Samplers are built-in options in Optuna to enable the selection of different sampling algorithms that optuna provides. Some of the available ones include - GridSampler, RandomSampler, TPESampler, etc. We'll use TPESampler for this demo, but feel free to try different samplers to notice the changes in performance. Tree-structured Parzen Estimator or TPE is based on independent sampling. It fits a Gaussian Mixture Model for each parameter in a trial `l(x)` and another GMM `g(x)` for other parameters. And it optimizes the `l(x)/g(x)` ratio to yield the best parameters.\n",

Put simply, a trial is a single call of the objective function while a set of trials make up a study.

The notebook can serve as a starting point for anyone looking to get started on using GPUs to run Hyperparameter Optimization and Feature Engineering experiments. These can add value by yielding better performing models much faster than CPU runs. MLflow helps in retaining the model information and makes it easier to save and load our best model, thus making it an useful choice for production. The combination of these libraries can save a lot of time and provide significant improvements in performance. \n",
