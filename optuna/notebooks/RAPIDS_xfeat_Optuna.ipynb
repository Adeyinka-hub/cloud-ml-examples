    "# Improving model performance with xfeat, RAPIDS and Optuna\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering is the processing of transforming raw data into features that can represent the underlying patterns of the data better. They can help boost the accuracy by a great deal and improve the ability of the model to generalise on unseen data. Every data scientist knows the importance feature engineering. Spending some time thinking about how best to apply and combine the available features can be very meaningful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hyper parameter Optimisation is another such process which can help complement a good model by tuning it's hyperparameters, which can have a tremendous impact on the accuracy of the model. The time and resources required for these processes are generally the reason they're overlooked. \n",
    "\n",
    "With xfeat, RAPIDS and Optuna - we aim to bridge these gaps and elevate the performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Optuna?\n",
    "[Optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna) s a lightweight framework for automatic hyperparameter optimization. It provides a define-by-run API, which makes it easy to adapt to any already existing code that we have and enables high modularity and the flexibility to construct hyperparameter spaces dynamically. By simply wrapping the objective function with Optuna can help perform a parallel-distributed HPO search over a search space. As we'll see in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is xfeat?\n",
    "[xfeat](https://github.com/pfnet-research/xfeat) is a feature engineering & exploration library using GPUs and Optuna. It provides a scikit-learn-like API for feature engineering with support for pandas and cuDF dataframes and cuPy arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MLflow?\n",
    "[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/https://mlflow.org/) MLflow is an, \"open source platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAPIDS?\n",
    "[RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/about.html) framework  provides a library suite that can execute end-to-end data science pipelines entirely on GPUs.  The libraries in the framework include [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) - a GPU Dataframe with pandas-like API, [cuML](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml) - implement machine learning algorithms that provide a scikit-learn-like API and many more. You can learn more [here](https://github.com/rapidsai).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll show how one can use these tools together to develop and improve a machine learning model. We'll use Airlines dataset (20M rows) to predict if a flight will be delayed or not. We'll explore how to use Optuna with RAPIDS and the speedups that we can achieve with the integration of these."

    "### Feature Selection and Hyper parameter Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have some new features, how do we know they are relevant for the task or represent anything meaningful? We use the feature selection process to do this. This helps in selection of a subset of features that are  most informative. This helps in simplifying the problem and ensures that we aren't overloading the system with unimportant features. Optuna provides a way to choose a `selector` which accepts a `Pipeline` object from xfeat. You can see in the `feature_selection` function we define a Pipeline that takes in an Explorer and a Selection Algorithm (`ChiSquareKBest`). We pass this to an Optuna Study object, along with an Objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function\n",
    "The objective function will be the one we optimize in Optuna Study. Objective funciton tries out different values for the parameters that we are tuning and saving the results in `study.trials_dataframes()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define the objective function for this HPO task by making use of the `train_and_eval()`. You can see that we simply choose a value for the parameters and call the `train_and_eval` method, making Optuna very easy to use in an existing workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective remains constant over different samplers, which are built-in options in Optuna to enable the selection of different sampling algorithms that optuna provides. Some of the available ones include - GridSampler, RandomSampler, TPESampler, etc. We'll use TPESampler for this demo, but feel free to try different samplers to notice the chnages in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### HPO Trials and Study\n",
    "Optuna uses [study](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/study.html) and [trials](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/trial.html) to keep track of the HPO experiments. Put simply, a trial is a single call of the objective function while a set of trials make up a study. We will pick the optimal performing trial from a study to get the best parameters that were used in that run."
